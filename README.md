# How to fork and clone
One quick note about cloning this project. If you wish to make commits and push your own code, you'll need to fork the project first. Forking allows you to have your own copy of this repository by adding a duplicate version in your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!
